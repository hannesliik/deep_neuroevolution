evolution strategies:
  - Adaptive std / annealing
  - combine weights of 2 parents
    - Average of 2
    - 50% and 50% - bernoulli distribution sampling?
    - research more?
  - http://blog.otoro.net/2017/10/29/visual-evolution-strategies/
    - CMA-ES? but probably too many parameters
    - Nothing about combining. Probably lots of people have tried and failed

selecting actions from distribution vs best action
